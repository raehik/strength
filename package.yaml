# raehik's extensions (GHC 9.2; last updated: 2022-10-05)
language: GHC2021
default-extensions:
# syntax that should be default
- LambdaCase
- ExplicitNamespaces # 7.6
- NoStarIsType

## deriving-related
- DerivingStrategies # 8.2
- DerivingVia # 8.6
- DeriveAnyClass

# features that should be default
- GADTs
- RoleAnnotations # 7.8

# other features
- DefaultSignatures
- TypeFamilies
- DataKinds

# other syntax
- MagicHash

# useful extensions to know about, but which should be specified on-demand
#
# UndecidableInstances:
#   required for type class wizardry
#   generally only enable if you were expecting to & compilation fails without
# AllowAmbiguousTypes:
#   often goes hand in hand with TypeApplications-heavy code
#   enabling on demand brings attention to the sort of functions to expect
# StarIsType:
#   may need to enable if you're working with old code that uses `Int :: *`
# ApplicativeDo:
#   fantastic, but may contain issues and surprises, and still new to most
#   Haskell programmers. suggest per-module
# CPP, TemplateHaskell: big scary extensions, only enable when using
#
# possible additions:
#
# OverloadedStrings:
#   incredibly useful but can force unexpected type annotations
#   I prefer enabling only in modules that deal with string-likes
# FunctionalDependencies:
#   less common extension but remains useful
# PatternSynonyms:
#   amazing but huge, and without enabling you can still use (just not define)
